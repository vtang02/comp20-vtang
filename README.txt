README for Victoria Tang's comp20-vtang private repository
==========================================================

1. What is the purpose of this git repository?  
This repository contains labs and assignments that I completed in COMP20
web programming.  

2.What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?  
My favorite assignment was the Marauder's Map because I learned how to use
a JSON API (chickenofthesea.herokuapp.com) and JavaScript API (google maps)
and geolocation.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 to now?  
I knew nothing about the web when I started the course. I had no idea 
what http was, how localstorage worked, or even what a client or server
were. Now I can say I know something about the web works, and that is 
pretty awesome. Even though I have learned a lot, I also realize that
the web is huge and I can keep learning more and more.

4. What was the most important thing you learned from this course?  
The client-server model. And also that google is my friend (but be careful
because there is a lot of incorrect info on the web).
