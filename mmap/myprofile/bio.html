		<p>
		Hi everyone! I'm Vicky. I'm currently at Senior at Tufts 
		University, studying Biology and maybe Computer Science. I don't
		know what I want to do after college, but the current goal is 
		to be employed and have my own cardboard box to live in. Some 
		random things about me...</p>

		<ul> 
			<li> I watch extreme-couponing hauls on Youtube and 
			read Yelp reviews for fun</li>
			<li> My favorite food is the COOKIE *all hail the 
			cookie*</li>
			<li> Sometimes I think I may be borderline addicted to 
			Facebook</li>
			<li> This past summer I worked at the Asian Community 
			Development Corporation</li>
			<li>I'm the president of the Vietnamese Students Club
			</li>
			<li> Clearly, I need to get better at talking about 
			myself</li>
		</ul>
