  <h1>Security Assessment of Arthurwhere herokuapp (Assignment 4)</h1>

  <p>By Victoria Tang</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--Description of the product and what you were hired to do -->
  <p>I am testing the security of <a href="http://arthurwhere.herokuapp.com/">arthurwhere</a>, Arthus Berman's <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html">Where in the World</a> assignment 3 for COMP20. 
The product of <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html">assignment 3</a> is a web interface that allows the user to see
the check-in coordinates sent to the MongoDB database. It also allowed users
to query for a login name and retrieve mbta redline coordinates. This 
application is also a JSON-based API that allows web developers to submit 
and retrieve check-in coordinates for Marauder's Map students and find 
check-ins based on login name.</p>
  <p>I was hired to find security vulnerabilities in this web application 
and propose solutions for them. I have found 4 security problems.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <!--Describe methodology used in testing app, and the tools used -->
  <p>I began with "black box" testing, where I attacked arthurwhere without
viewing the source code. I submitted various malicious check-ins to the
herokuapp by using curl and found several vulnerabilities. Then I viewed the
source code and did a code review of it. After viewing the source code, I
was able to better understand how my attacks during black-box testing were
working.</p>

  <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
  <!--Provide an overview of all the security issues you identified -->
  <p>The security vulnerabilities I found were all due to the application 
assuming that user input is valid, correctly formatted, and not malicious.
We cannot assume that the user will always give input in the correct format.
For example, a hacker can insert script  and html tags into the login field,
allowing potentially malicious code and html content to the page. A hacker
 is also allowed to input whatever lat/lng he wants, thus falsifying his 
location and potentially. The solution to these input validation problems 
would be to filter out invalid user input </p>

  <h2>Issues Found</h2>
  
  <div>
  <h3>1. Cross-Site Scripting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Affects /sendLocation page</li>
      <li><span>Risk: High</span>    Hackers can insert html tags, script 
tags, and other unexpected input. Users of this API expect valid login names
and would not be able to handle JSON in an unexpected format.</li>
      <li>Description: Inserting html or javascript in the login field 
could cause a user's application to run that code or modify that user's 
page. In the first screenshot, submitting a login as <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; alert("1111"); &lt;/script&gt;</code> yielded an alert box on 
the web
interface. If a client application received a script as a login, it could
execute this script, which would be dangerous and could crash the application
depending on the script contents. Similarly, in the second screenshot, an 
iframe was inserted into the login field. This type of input is definitely what
the client application wants.</li>
      
      <li><img src="1111login.PNG" alt="script alert box"></li>
      <li><img src="iframecorgi.png" alt="omfg dogs"></li>
     
      <li>Resolution: This issue can be resolved by sanitizing inputs before 
they are inserted into the database. HTML escaping on could be done to filter
out potentially dangerous characters. According to <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Talk:Testing_for_Cross_site_scripting">OWASP</a>, we could the PHP function strip_tags() to remove html tags and htmlspecialcharacters() to
encode characters like &, <, and > into html. This way, the client application
will not mistake input as being executable //WHAT IS THE CODE THO</li>      
    </ul>
  </div>
 
  <div>
  <h3>2. Request Injection Attack</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Affects /locations.json page</li>
	<li><span>Risk: Medium</span>    Querying the database with 
"login[$ne]=username" will return all entries in which the login is NOT the same
as the username. The attacker could use this to trick the server into running
unintended queries or accessing data with authentication. However, there is a
solution to this security vulnerability.</li> 
	<li>Description: Using [$ne] (or other MongoDB fields like $gt to get
entries greater than or $where to pass javascript functions) can be dangerous.
If there is private data or check-ins that the client should not be accessing,
[$ne] would show them this private data. For example, in the image below, 
querying in [$ne] "break" returned a JSON object with all entries whose logins
were not "break". However, some of the entries had malicious or improper fields.
 Perhaps the client should not be able to use those improper entries.</li>
	
	<li><img src="requestinjection.png" alt="$ne query"></li>
	
	<li>Resolution: In app.post for sendLocation, we could parse the login 
for "[", "]", and "$" and then convert them to encoded form. We could also 
perform character stripping in which we forbid characters like "[", "]", and 
"$" in the login. //WHAT IS THE CODE THO??</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
  <h3>3. Access Control</h3>
  <!--the issue name, location where issues was found/severity of issue
with justification/description of issue--how did you find it and screenshot / 
proof of vulnerability with screenshot/resolution--show code -->
     <ul>
       <li>Affects / , /locations.json, and /redline.json</li>
       <li><span>Risk: Low</span>   Currently, any and all domains are able
to access data from the database using this API web application. If our
database contains private information, we would not want everyone to be able to
access that information.</li> 
       <li>Description: As seen in the first image below, loading the / page 
with TamperData for Mozilla firefox suggested that cross-origin resource sharing
 was allowed for all "*" domains ("access-control-allow-origin *" in the 
Response Header section). Upon viewing the source code, I saw <code>res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");</code> and <code>res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");</code>. This 
is problematic because with this any domain can access the check-in
information. This becomes an issue when too many people are querying the 
database and the server becomes slow. Also, an API should generally have an
intended audience, and not any/all domains. 
</li>
       <li><img src="CORS.PNG" alt= "tamper data"</li>
       <li>Resolution: The solution would be to set access control such that
only the intended users of the API may access it. Since assignment3 was 
supposed to be the server used in assignment2, which is hosted on github, it 
would make sense to use <code>response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "github.com")</code> instead. This way, only clients on github could access 
check-in information.</li>
     </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
  <h3>4. Falsification of Data</h3>
     <ul>
       <li> Affects /sendLocation (but really the entire web application</li>
       <li><span>Risk: High</span>    It is very easy for an attacker to submit
a false latitude and longititude check-in to the database, and this is arugably
the most important security vulnerability of all.</li>
       <li>Description: Using <code>curl --data "login=break&lat=10000000&lng=1000000" arthurwhere.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</code> I was able to falsify my 
coordinates. In the first image below, 1000000 and 1000000 are obviously 
invalid latitudes and longitudes
but they were still inserted as entries into the database. The Marauder's Map
expected valid coordinates, and if it received these coordinates, it may not be
properly equipped to handle this invalid input.</li>
       <li><img src="NaNvalidator.png" alt="bad latlng"></li>
       <li>Similarly, using <code>curl --data "login=breakyeah&lat=MEOW&lng=MEOW" arthurwhere.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</code> I was still able to create an
entry in the database even though "MEOW" is not a valid coordinate. The lat and
lng were recorded as NaN (as seen in the image above), suggesting that there 
was some error handling in the server but probably not enough. 
After a code review code review, I saw <code>lat: parseFloat(request.body.lat)</code> and <code>lng: parseFloat(request.body.lng)</code> (see image below).
 parseFloat parses
a string a returns a floating point number. Again, the Marauder's Map client
would be able to handle invalid lat and lng like NaN becuase it is expecting
lat to be -90 to 90 and lng to be -180 to 180. </li>
       <li><img src="parsefloat.PNG" alt="parse float"</li>
       <li>Resoltuion: The solution to this problem would be to use the 
validator. In the package.json, install the validator as a dependency. In the
server.js, utilize error handling such as:</li>
       <li><code>if (login != undefinied && lat != undefined && lng !=
undefined && validator.isFloat(lat) && validator.isFloat(lng)) { </br>
	   if (lng <= -180 && lng >= -180 && lat <= 90 && lat >= -90) { </br>
</code> and then inserting the entry into the locations collection. This 
solution addresses invalid input, but we still need to prevent attackers
from falsifying their coordinates (even if those coordinates are formatted
correctly). We need to make sure that coordinates are being sent from the 
user's actual location. To do this, the user of the Marauder's Map could get a
randomly generated access code and would need to enter that code before being
so send his lat and lng to the server database. This way, attackers could not
post false coordinates to the database because they would not have an access
code</li>
     </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <!--Future considerations and recommendations with costs -->
  <p>These security vulnerabilities make it easy for an attacker to abuse 
arthurwhere.herokuapp.com. Cross-site scripting allows for unwanted 
javascript actions. Request injection makes potentially private information
to be accessed. Fully open access to the API allows any domain, intended or
unintended, to access check-in information. Falsification of location is the
biggest issue, because an attacker can pretend to be anywhere in the world,
and this issue makes it difficult to trust the coordinates we get from the 
API. Attackers could take advantage of these vulnerabilities to break the
application and give incorrect information to users of Marauder's Map. If 
users notice this incorrect information, the will stop using the Marauder's 
Map. If my suggested solutions are implemented, this application will be 
much more secure. I would charge $300 to implement these changes. I would
also perform a follow-up security evaluation to check for remaining
security issues.</p>
