  <h1>Security Assessment of Arthurwhere herokuapp (Assignment 4)</h1>

  <p>By Victoria Tang</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--Description of the product and what you were hired to do -->
  <p>I am testing the security of <a href="http://arthurwhere.herokuapp.com/">arthurwhere</a>, Arthus Berman's <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html">Where in the World</a> assignment 3 for COMP20. 
The product of <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html">assignment 3</a> is a web interface that allows the user to see
the check-in coordinates sent to the MongoDB database. It also allowed users
to query for a login name and retrieve mbta redline coordinates. This 
application is also a JSON-based API that allows web developers to submit 
and retrieve check-in coordinates for Marauder's Map students and find 
check-ins based on login name.</p>
  <p>I was hired to find security vulnerabilities in this web application 
and propose solutions for them. I have found 4 security problems.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <!--Describe methodology used in testing app, and the tools used -->
  <p>I began with "black box" testing, where I attacked arthurwhere without
viewing the source code. I submitted various malicious check-ins to the
herokuapp by using curl and found several vulnerabilities. Then I viewed the
source code and did a code review of it. After viewing the source code, I
was able to better understand how my attacks during black-box testing were
working.</p>

  <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
  <!--Provide an overview of all the security issues you identified -->
  <p>The security vulnerabilities I found were all due to the application 
assuming that user input is valid, correctly formatted, and not malicious.
We cannot assume that the user will always give input in the correct format.
For example, a hacker can insert script  and html tags into the login field,
allowing potentially malicious code and html content to the page. A hacker
 is also allowed to input whatever lat/lng he wants, thus falsifying his 
location and potentially. The solution to these input validation problems 
would be to filter out invalid user input </p>
